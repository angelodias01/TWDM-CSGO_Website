                        "Counter-Strike 2 represents the biggest technical advancement in Counter-Strike history,
                        ensuring new features and updates for many years to come. All the new features will be revealed
                        when the game is officially launched this summer, but the journey to Counter-Strike 2 begins
                        today with a limited test for selected CS:GO players.
                        <br>During the test, we will evaluate a subset of features to address any possible issues before
                        the
                        global release. Counter-Strike 2 will be available this summer as a free update for CS:GO. So,
                        gear up with your arsenal, hone your skills, and get ready for what's coming!"

                    <h4>The Tickrate</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Previously, the server only evaluated the state of the match at intervals of time called "ticks."
                        Counter-Strike 2 has been developed to utilize updates between ticks, known as "sub-ticks."
                        Thanks to the sub-tick update architecture of Counter-Strike 2, servers now know the exact
                        moment when a movement is initiated, a bullet is fired, or a grenade is thrown.
                        <br>As a result, regardless of the tickrate, your movement and shots will have the same
                        responsiveness, and your grenades will always behave consistently.
                    </p>
